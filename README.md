===============================

This game is my 5th project for the Udaicty Front-End Web Dev nanodgree.  The goal is to create an arcage frogger game using Object Oriented JS and HTML5 Canvas.  Images and a game loop engine is provided.  The rest should be built!

How to Play:

Use the arrow keys to move the player across the board. Reaching the water is a win, colliding with a bug is a lose.
