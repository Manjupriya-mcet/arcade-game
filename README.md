===============================

##Description: 

This game is my 5th project for the Udaicty Front-End Web Dev nanodgree.  The goal is to create a classic arcage frogger game using the newly acquired skills in Object Oriented JS and HTML5 Canvas.  Images and a game loop engine are provided.  The rest should be built in app.js file!

##How to Play:

Click [here] (https://mashablair.github.io/arcade-game/) to open the game. 

Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the player across the board. Reaching the water is a win, colliding with a bug is a lose.

##Enjoy it!  :)
